President Trump again admonished Republican senators before their Tuesday vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. "now is the time to keep your promise."

"For last seven years Republicans have been united in standing up for Obamacare's victims. They kept saying it over and over again, every Republican running for office promised immediate relief," said Mr. Trump in his White House remarks on Monday.

"So far, Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare."

He added, "We, as a party, must fulfill that promise to repeal and replace, what they've been saying for the past 7 years."
